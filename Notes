Recap: Class 1

What is testNG.
Testng is a tool we use to automate applications.

why do we need it?
reports
parallel execution
annotation based execution
grouping
data driven testing
multiple options for execution


@Test annotation - this is the main annotation of testng to execute our TC

it executes test cases in alphabetical order by default

@before method as a precondition that executes before every tc
@after method as a postcondition that executes after every tc

Class 2 -
User story 12345 - Admin user should be able to login with valid credentials

User story 22345 - Verify the title of the application

Priority - by default it is set to 0
to prioritize the test cases, we use this attribute

enable and disable - to make any test case enabled or disabled temporarily we use  this attribute


Assertions:
Hard Assertions - Assertions we use for small execution because it stops execution if encounters error
Soft assertions - Assertions we use to execute complete code with multiple check points and in the end we use assertall method
to get the collective failure of test case

mac users - option cmd L
windows users - clt alt L


Testng.xml where highest level is suite --> test --> packages --> class --> methods (@Test)

groups - we use different groups to separate the test cases

alwaysrun = true - we use this attribute to execute the pre and post condition from testng.xml file
